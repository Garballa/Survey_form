# Ultimate_Pizza_Survey
This survey was created as part of Free Code Camp's responsive web design certification curriculum.
That being said, it's not entirely functional, but exists to show I have a grasp on how to make a proper survey with differnet input types.
I went a few extra steps by importing a font from Google, and taught myself how to modify the opacity of div backgrounds.
